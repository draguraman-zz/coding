public class Node {
    public Node next;
    public Object data;
}

Then your linked list will have as a member one node representing the head (start) of the list:

public class LinkedList {
    private Node head;
}

Then you need to add functionality to the list by adding methods. They usually involve some sort of traversal along all of the nodes.

public void printAllNodes() {
    Node cur = head;
    while (cur.next != null) 
    {
        Console.WriteLine(cur.data);
        cur = cur.next;
    }
}

Also, inserting new data is another common operation:

public void Add(Object data) {
    Node toAdd = new Node();
    toAdd.data = data;
    Node current = head;
    // traverse all nodes (see the print all nodes method for an example)
    current.Next = toAdd;
